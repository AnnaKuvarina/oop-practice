# OOP Practice:
Imagine that we have a burgers service with menu which should be available for a user (via web interface and be an API for the mobile app).
Refactor code using S.O.L.I.D. approach. Add a few appropriate design patterns to achieve better code quality and structure improvements with your own knowledge or learned during seminars.

## Tasks:
1. refactor application classes according to S.O.L.I.D. and OOP principles
2. refactor application code to appropriate design patterns
3. create a sequence UML diagram described in uml/Readme.md;

Each task should be completed as a merge request with the following title. 
*OOP-{task number}: {short explanation of completed task}*

## Start app
Install dependencies

```shell
npm i
```

Run local server
```shell
npm run dev
```


Server is running on http://localhost:8000/. Port can be changed in ./src/constants/server.ts.
